# mlh-december-hackathon

This is our first repo for the MLH December Hackathon. This version differs from our final version because it only works on localhost, as we stored the diary entries as a local file inside the project, which was not a feasable way to save data when the app was deployed. Due to a plethora of errors, therefore, we switched to saving diary entires on a Deta database, making retrieval from the cloud possible.
Our final project repo is titled "sneha_december_hackathon".
